# PHONETICS
## Summary 
The first chapter discusses the intricacies of speech production and pronunciation, particularly in the context of learning new languages. It highlights that while speaking is mostly automatic in one's native language, learning a foreign language requires conscious effort due to unfamiliar sounds and articulations. For instance, German learners of English struggle with sounds like "lisping" in words such as "bath" and "therapy" due to the absence of such sounds in German. Similarly, English learners of German face difficulties with unfamiliar vowels.

Also, the field of phonetics is introduced, which deals with the study of speech sounds, including articulatory phonetics, acoustic phonetics  and auditory phonetics. What is more, the text emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between spelling and pronunciation, noting that spelling does not always reflect sound structure accurately. It introduces the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) as a standardized system for representing speech sounds, providing examples of IPA symbols for British English sounds. Additionally, it mentions variations in transcription systems, such as those used in North American English studies.
