## Chapter 5.4.1

In chapter 5.4.1, the focus is on the organization of word meaning in the mental lexicon. The mental lexicon, similar to a comprehensive dictionary, stores words known as "lexemes" and facilitates their use in language production and comprehension. The chapter explores the role of word relations in defining meaning. It emphasizes that words are interconnected in a network-like structure within the mental lexicon, and these connections play a crucial role in determining word meaning. Additionally, the chapter explores the properties of sense relations and connotations, highlighting how these influence the network of word meanings. In general, chapter 5.4.1 provides insight into the organization of word meanings within the mental lexicon, emphasizing the interconnectedness of words and the role of word relations in shaping meaning.

## Chapter 5.4.2

Chapter 5.4.2 discusses the semantic relations between words within the mental lexicon. It explores how words are interconnected through various semantic relationships such as hyponymy and oppositeness, attempting to explain how these sense relations differ from connotation and contribute to the organization of word meanings. The chapter highlights the crucial role that semantic relations play in linking words within the mental lexicon, emphasizing how these connections create a structured network of word meanings. By examining how semantic relations shape the relationships between different words, the chapter provides insights into the web of connections that exist within the mental lexicon, highlighting the significance of these semantic relationships in organizing and defining word meanings.

## Chapter 5.5

Chapter 5.5 focuses on the discipline of semantics, which is concerned with the meaning of linguistic expressions. It highlights that meaning is a relational property that describes the connection between the form of a linguistic expression and a mental concept, distinct from the relation linking linguistic expressions and the objects, events, or situations they refer to. The chapter discusses the different levels at which meaning arises, distinguishing between compositional and non-compositional types of meaning based on whether the meaning involves the combination of parts of the expression. It delves into how meaning is organized in the mental lexicon, likening it to a vast network where lexemes are interconnected through various semantic links, including sense relations like hyponymy and oppositeness, as well as connotation. By exploring the organization of word meanings in the mental lexicon, the chapter underscores the network of semantic relationships that shape our understanding of language and how words are interconnected based on their meanings.
